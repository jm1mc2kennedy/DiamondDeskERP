# Repository Organization Summary

**Date**: 2025-07-20T23:50:00Z
**Scope**: Complete project structure reorganization and cleanup

## Summary

Successfully organized the DiamondDeskERP iOS project repository by moving 35+ misplaced files from the root directory into appropriate subdirectories, creating a clean and maintainable project structure.

## Actions Completed

### 1. Documentation Organization ✅
Created `/Documentation` directory with organized subdirectories:
- **AI/**: AI build state, logs, error indices, insights (8 files)
- **Phases/**: Project plans, completion reports, enterprise strategy (8 files)  
- **Implementation/**: Feature implementation docs (6 files)
- **Reports/**: Audit reports, summaries, integration docs (7 files)
- **Root**: iOS references and general documentation (1 file)

### 2. Swift File Organization ✅
Moved Swift files to appropriate feature/domain directories:
- **CRM Features**: ClientListView.swift, ClientModel.swift, ClientViewModel.swift → `Sources/Features/CRM/`
- **Task Management**: TaskListView.swift, TaskModel.swift, TaskViewModel.swift → `Sources/Features/Tasks/`
- **Ticket System**: TicketListView.swift, TicketModel.swift, TicketViewModel.swift → `Sources/Features/Tickets/`
- **Analytics**: KPIListView.swift, KPIViewModel.swift → `Sources/Features/Analytics/` (created)
- **Domain Models**: User.swift, Store.swift, StoreReportModel.swift → `Sources/Domain/`
- **Services**: RoleGatingService.swift, UserProvisioningService.swift → `Sources/Services/`
- **Core Utilities**: EnvironmentKeys.swift, View+RoleGated.swift, Seeder.swift → `Sources/Core/`

### 3. Data Organization ✅
