## Implementation Details

### Event Monitoring Capabilities

#### Event Types & Categories
```swift
// System Events
EventType.system: "app_start", "background_entry", "memory_warning"

// User Events  
EventType.user: "task_create", "ticket_update", "client_view"

// CloudKit Events
EventType.cloudkit: "fetch_success", "save_error", "sync_conflict"

// Performance Events
EventType.performance: "slow_query", "memory_spike", "render_lag"

// Error Events
EventType.error: "validation_failure", "network_timeout", "crash"

// Security Events
EventType.security: "auth_failure", "permission_denied", "data_breach"

// Analytics Events
EventType.analytics: "consent_granted", "tracking_disabled", "export_request"

// Metrics Events
EventType.metrics: "kpi_calculated", "report_generated", "baseline_updated"
```

#### Alert System Logic
```swift
// Critical Issues Detection
- Critical Errors: Immediate alert trigger
- High Error Threshold: 3+ high severity errors = critical status
- Performance Issues: Automatic performance alert increment
- CloudKit Issues: CloudKit error pattern detection
- Memory Monitoring: Memory usage tracking and alerts
```

### System Metrics Collection

#### Real-time Monitoring
```swift
// 30-second interval collection:
- Memory Usage (MB): Process memory footprint
- CPU Usage (%): Current CPU utilization
- Active Events: Current event history count
- Error Count: Total error history count
- Last Event Info: Type and timestamp of most recent event
```

#### Performance Integration
```swift
// Automatic integration with existing infrastructure:
- Performance Baseline Service: Metric correlation
- Accessibility Service: Event logging for a11y actions
- Conflict Logging Service: Conflict event capture
- Localization Service: Translation event tracking
- Analytics Consent: Consent change monitoring
```

### Data Persistence & Export

#### Event Storage
```swift
// In-memory storage with limits:
- Event History: 1000 events (FIFO replacement)
- Error History: 500 errors (FIFO replacement)
- Metrics History: Real-time calculation
- Alert Summary: Cumulative counters with reset capability
```

#### Export Format
```swift
// Structured export format:
DIAMOND DESK ERP - EVENT QA LOG
Generated: 2025-07-20T12:00:00Z

=== EVENTS ===
timestamp | type | category | action | details

=== ERRORS ===  
timestamp | ERROR | category | severity | message
```

## Integration Points

### Admin Dashboard Integration
```swift
// Add to AdminDashboardView:
NavigationLink("Event QA Console") {
    EventQAConsoleView()
}
.badge(eventQAService.alertSummary.totalErrors > 0 ? 
       eventQAService.alertSummary.totalErrors : nil)
```

### Service Integration
```swift
// Automatic integration with existing services:
1. PerformanceBaselineService → Performance event logging
2. AccessibilityValidationService → Accessibility event tracking  
3. ConflictLoggingService → Conflict event capture
4. LocalizationValidationService → Localization event monitoring
5. AnalyticsConsentService → Consent event tracking
```

### Notification Integration
```swift
// CloudKit operation monitoring:
NotificationCenter.default.post(
    name: .cloudKitOperationCompleted,
    object: nil,
    userInfo: [
        "operation": "fetchTasks",
        "success": true,
        "duration": 0.245
    ]
)

// Performance metric recording:
NotificationCenter.default.post(
    name: .performanceMetricRecorded,
    object: nil,
    userInfo: [
        "metric": "task_list_load_time",
        "value": 387.5,
        "threshold": 500.0
    ]
)
```

## Security & Privacy

- Memory management with automatic cleanup
```

### Access Control
```swift
// Admin-only access:
- Role-based access through existing RoleGating
