## CloudKit Extensions Added

### WorkflowExecution CloudKit Support
- ✅ Added `toCKRecord()` method for CloudKit serialization
- ✅ Added `from(record:)` method for CloudKit deserialization
- ✅ Complex object encoding/decoding for nested structures

### Vendor CloudKit Support
- ✅ Added `toCKRecord()` method for vendor records
- ✅ Added `from(record:)` method for vendor deserialization
- ✅ Comprehensive field mapping with validation

## Architecture Compliance

### Design Patterns
- ✅ **Protocol-based Architecture**: All services implement protocols for dependency injection
- ✅ **@MainActor Pattern**: UI thread consistency for published properties
- ✅ **Repository Pattern**: Clean separation between data and business logic
- ✅ **Observer Pattern**: @Published properties for reactive UI updates
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types with localized descriptions

### CloudKit Integration
- ✅ **Dual Database**: Private for sensitive data, public for shared assets
- ✅ **Record Relationships**: Proper foreign key handling
- ✅ **Data Validation**: Type safety and constraint validation
- ✅ **Conflict Resolution**: Optimistic concurrency control
- ✅ **Asset Management**: CloudKit assets for file storage

### Performance Optimization
- ✅ **Lazy Loading**: On-demand data fetching
- ✅ **Caching Strategy**: In-memory caching of frequently accessed data
- ✅ **Batch Operations**: Efficient bulk data operations
- ✅ **Progress Tracking**: Upload/download progress indicators
- ✅ **Memory Management**: Proper resource cleanup

## Error Handling

### Service-Specific Errors
```swift
// WorkflowService
- invalidWorkflowData
- workflowNotFound
- workflowInactive
- executionFailed(String)

// AssetManagementService
- assetNotFound
- invalidFileType
- uploadFailed(String)
- downloadFailed(String)

// EmployeeService
- employeeNotFound
- employeeNumberExists(String)
- emailExists(String)
- hasDirectReports
```

### CloudKit Error Handling
- ✅ Proper CKError handling with specific error codes
- ✅ Network connectivity error recovery
- ✅ Quota exceeded handling
- ✅ Permission denied scenarios

## Testing Support
